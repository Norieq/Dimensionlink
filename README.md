An osu! skin inspired by Miraie as the musical artist and Sei as the Artwork maker.

Long story short, I got this Idea after hearing the song "facade" ("facade" was the name that I'm gonna use for the skin but I changed it) I got pointed by Sei's artwork. The artstyle is amazing giving the limited color pallete a new life in my eyes. Just gonna be real, A lot of people doesn't like Miraie Seeing the "childish" things he do on the internet, or maybe people just don't understand the art that he's making or the story of Miraie's life.

Miraie is now a Musical artist. He make less video and make more music. Many people likes Miraie and many people hates Miraie. But in the end, we all just seeing at one side of things. We don't look the full perspective. Even one of my friend saying that Miraie suck. And I didn't mad at him. I didn't do anything. it's their decision to hate something. not us.

end.

Ps: If you hate me, it's your choice I can't make you like me. I'm a just a human having a dream of being in someone's body cause my life sucks. Peace.
